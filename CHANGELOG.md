## [Unreleased]

The first public version. Everything below is new.

### Added

- `sy`, one static Go binary for Linux, macOS and Windows (Windows without peers and the owner
  key): hooks and status line recording into a local outbox, `sy status`, `sy doctor`,
  `sy update`.
- `sy setup`: detects Claude Code config folders, labels and colours accounts, makes them share
  settings, instructions, add-ons, plugins, MCP servers, history and prompts, adds launchers,
  and installs the Claude Code plugin. Shows a plan first, backs up every change, and
  `sy setup --undo` reverses a run.
- The hub (`sy hub serve`): SQLite storage of every record, session states, usage windows per
  account, analytics, a read API and a live stream, pairing and per-device tokens, backups,
  export and import. Runs as a user service, with Docker or with systemd.
- The board: a web UI served by the hub that installs on a phone as a web app, `sy board` in a
  terminal, and a pane inside Claude Code.
- Alerts for sessions that need you, failures, limit thresholds and silent machines, through
  Web Push, ntfy and the Android app, with quiet hours, private notifications, snooze and
  batching.
- More machines through direct connection, an SSH port forward, or pull over SSH.
- The desktop app (Linux, macOS, Windows): one claude.ai tab per account, opt-in usage reading
  per account, the board in a Hub view, OS notifications and a tray.
- The Android app: the board's screens, notifications over its own connection to the hub (no
  third-party push service), Open, Snooze and Seen, six home-screen widgets, and an updater.
- Keys and peers: an owner key, machine certificates, a signed link between devices and the
  hub, and end-to-end encrypted messages between your own Claude Code sessions, gated by a
  peers matrix.
- Documentation: user guides, architecture, behaviour specs, contributing guide and security
  policy.
- Licensed under Apache-2.0.
