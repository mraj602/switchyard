# Paths

Status: spec v1. Implemented in `internal/paths`. Every other package gets
its folders from there; nothing else builds paths from `$HOME`.

`sy` uses three folders:

| Folder | Holds | Can be lost? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **config** | `config.toml` only. | Recreated by `sy setup` / `sy connect`. |
| **state** | Machine id, device token, outbox, caches, logs, setup backups. | Losing it loses unflushed records and makes this a new machine. |
| **data** | The hub database and its backups. Only on the machine that runs the hub. | No: this is the long-term record. |

## 1. Locations

| | Linux, WSL, BSD | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| config | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.config/switchyard`) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.config/switchyard`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Switchyard\config` |
| state | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.local/state/switchyard`) | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.local/state/switchyard`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Switchyard\state` |
| data | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.local/share/switchyard`) | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/switchyard` (default `~/.local/share/switchyard`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Switchyard\data` |

XDG variables are used only when set to an absolute path (the XDG rule); otherwise the
default applies. On Windows, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is used if set and absolute, else
`<home>\AppData\Local`; XDG variables are ignored there.

**Overrides** (in this order, first wins):

1. `SY_CONFIG_DIR`, `SY_STATE_DIR`, `SY_DATA_DIR`: one folder each.
   Overrides must be absolute paths: a relative one is an error (a hook's working folder
   is arbitrary, so a relative path would scatter state).
2. `SY_HOME`: sets all three to `$SY_HOME/config`, `$SY_HOME/state`, `$SY_HOME/data`. Used by
   tests and by running a second, throwaway `sy` next to the real one.
3. The table above.

`sy` never reads `SWITCHYARD_DATA`.

`sy paths` prints the three folders and where each came from; `sy doctor` shows the
same.

## 2. Decisions and why

### Linux: `~/.config/switchyard` is shared

An Electron app named `switchyard` would keep its user data in `~/.config/switchyard`
(`~/Library/Application Support/switchyard` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\switchyard` on Windows), and
older versions of Switchyard did. `sy` still uses `~/.config/switchyard` as its config folder,
so the folder can hold other files that `sy` does not own.

The desktop app (`app/`, package `switchyard-desktop`) sets its user data explicitly, before
`ready`, to `<appData>/switchyard-desktop` (desktop.md C1):

| | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| desktop app user data | `~/.config/switchyard-desktop` | `~/Library/Application Support/switchyard-desktop` | `%APPDATA%\switchyard-desktop` |

Electron would otherwise derive `Switchyard` from `productName`. `SY_APP_USER_DATA`
(absolute) overrides the folder for development and tests, and only in an unpackaged build.

`sy` keeps to strict rules in `~/.config/switchyard`:

- `sy` owns exactly one name in that folder: `config.toml` (plus its transient
  `.config.toml.<random>.tmp` during an atomic write, and `config.toml.bak` written by
  `sy setup`).
- `sy` never creates any other file there, never lists, cleans, moves or deletes the folder,
  and never reads other files in it.
- `sy uninstall --purge` removes only `config.toml` and `config.toml.bak`, never the folder.
- Neither desktop app writes `config.toml`. The desktop app reads what it needs by running
  `sy` (`sy desktop info --json` and the other commands of desktop.md C11); it does not open
  `config.toml` or any `sy` folder itself.
- If `sy` creates the folder, it uses mode `0700`, as Electron does.

Why not a separate name such as `~/.config/switchyard-sy` or `~/.config/sy`: the
docs all say `~/.config/switchyard/config.toml`; `sy` is a short, generic
name likely to clash with other tools. The rules above make sharing the folder harmless:
there is no file-name overlap and `sy` never deletes the folder.

Everything that `sy` writes often, and everything that matters (outbox, token, machine id),
lives in the state folder, which nothing else uses.

### macOS: XDG layout, not `~/Library/Application Support`

An earlier design put macOS state in `~/Library/Application Support/Switchyard`. But an Electron
app's default user-data folder on macOS is `~/Library/Application Support/<name>`, and the
default APFS volume is case-insensitive, so that would be the **same folder** as an Electron
app's. Putting the outbox and the device token inside an app's folder is exactly the clash we
want to avoid. So on macOS `sy` uses the same `~/.config` / `~/.local/state` / `~/.local/share`
layout as on Linux. Command-line tools commonly do this on macOS (git, gh, fish), it is the
same on every Unix machine (simpler docs, the same paths on SSH servers), and there is no
clash: the desktop app uses its own `~/Library/Application Support/switchyard-desktop`.

launchd agents still go in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, and their logs go to the
state folder.

### Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, not `%APPDATA%`

Electron's user data on Windows is `%APPDATA%\switchyard` (roaming). `sy` uses
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Switchyard`, which does not clash, and which does not roam: the machine id,
device token and outbox are per machine and must never be copied to another computer by a
roaming profile. Config also lives there, so a roaming profile does not carry one machine's
hub token to another. Subfolders `config`, `state`, `data` keep the three roles apart inside
one folder.

```

Runtime sockets (Linux, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`): `sy/agent.sock` and `sy/r/<16 hex>.sock`, folders The agent socket falls back to `$TMPDIR/sy-<uid>/agent.sock` when the path would exceed the sun_path limit (103 bytes macOS, 107 Linux).
0700, sockets 0600 (peers.md 2.3, 8.6). `sy` reads, never writes, each slot's
`<config>/sessions/<pid>.json` and never opens `sessions/*.key` (identity.md 4).

Outside these folders, machine management writes only `~/.ssh/switchyard.conf` and one `Include` line in
`~/.ssh/config` on the operator (forward mode), and one line in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on a
pulled remote (machines.md 3.3, 3.4); both are journaled and undone by `sy machine remove`.
The terminal integration writes only its own `switchyard-*.toml` tab configs in Warp's tab config folder
(terminal.md T8), journaled and undone by `sy term warp off` or `sy setup --undo`.

Inside a Docker image the hub uses `SY_DATA_DIR=/data` (a volume).

## 4. `config.toml`

TOML, read with a small, well-maintained parser (candidate
`github.com/pelletier/go-toml/v2`). Unknown keys are kept on rewrite and reported by
`sy doctor`. Written atomically (temp file, fsync, rename), preserving comments where the
parser allows; `sy config set` is the supported way to change it. `sy config set hub.url <url>`
applies the same check as `sy connect` (plain `http` only to loopback or Tailscale
(`*.ts.net` names, `100.64.0.0/10` addresses), unless `hub.insecure_lan` is true or `--insecure-lan` is given, which
records it) and stores the normalised scheme://host[:port].

```

The device token is **not** in this file (it lives in `<state>/token`), so `config.toml` can
be shown or shared without leaking anything.
