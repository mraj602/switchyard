# Tokens and devices

Status: spec v1. Implemented in `internal/hub/auth`. Pairing is in pairing.md.

Every device that talks to the hub has its own token. The hub stores only a hash. A token is
revoked on its own, without touching any other device.

## 1. Format

```
sy_<k>_<43 base62 characters>
```

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sy_` | Fixed prefix, so secret scanners and `grep` can find leaked tokens. |
| `<k>` | One letter for the device kind: `m` machine, `d` desktop, `p` phone, `b` browser, `o` owner session. |
| `_` | Separator. |
| 43 base62 characters | 32 random bytes from the OS cryptographic source, encoded big-endian in base62 (`0-9A-Za-z`), left-padded with `0` to 43 characters. |

Example shape: `sy_m_4fQx0Lr2…` (48 characters in total). Base62 has no `-` or `_`, so a
double click selects the whole token and the kind letter can always be parsed.

The kind letter is a hint for people and for `wy doctor`. The hub never trusts it: scopes
come from the `device` row.

## 2. Storage

- The hub stores `device.token_hash` = SHA-256 of the full token string (including the
  prefix), as 32 raw bytes, with a unique index. Lookup is one indexed read.
- Exception, owner sessions (`sy_o_`, pairing.md 4): `token_hash` = HMAC-SHA256(`pair_pepper`,
  `"token:"` ‖ token), with the pairing pepper that lives outside the database (pairing.md 3).
  A `sy_o_` token is looked up only by that hash, and a device with the `owner` scope (or
  `created_by` `owner-link:…`) is accepted only through a `sy_o_` token. So write access to
  `hub.db` alone cannot mint an owner session (keys.md 5.4): a row it writes either has a
  plain hash (refused for the owner scope) or needs the pepper. Owner sessions made before this
  rule are revoked by migration 7.
- No salt or slow hash: the token has 256 bits of entropy, so a stolen hash cannot be
  brute-forced. (A slow hash is used only for the owner password.)
- Comparison is done by looking up the hash, so no timing-sensitive string compare is
  needed.
- `device.token_hint` = kind prefix + `…` + last 4 characters (`sy_m_…k3Qz`), for lists.
- The token is shown once, when created. It cannot be recovered; a lost token is replaced.

On a client the token lives in `<state>/token`, mode `0600`, one line, no trailing data
(see [paths.md](paths.md)). It is never put in `config.toml`, `settings.json`, hook
commands, environment variables of Claude Code, or records.

## 3. Scopes

| Device kind | Token | Scopes | Can |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| machine | `sy_m_` | `write` | `POST /v1/ingest` for its own machine id only. Also, by design (keys.md 3.3, peers.md 5.4): propose an owner key (`POST /v1/keys/owner`; it stays pending until an owner confirms its fingerprint, at most one pending, deleted after 24 hours), and narrow the peer matrix or pause peers (`PUT /v1/peers/matrix`, `POST /v1/peers/pause`; widening and resuming need the owner). |
| desktop | `sy_d_` | `write`, `read` | Ingest for its own machine id (web usage); every read endpoint and `/v1/stream`. |
| phone | `sy_p_` | `read`, `push` | Every read endpoint and `/v1/stream`; register push targets; snooze/seen alerts. |
| browser | `sy_b_` | `read`, `push` | As phone; for the installed web app on a computer. |
| owner session | `sy_o_` | `owner`, `read`, `push` | Everything, including devices, rules and pairing codes. A `browser` device from `wy hub owner-link`, 30 days, cookie only (pairing.md 4). |

Scope checks per endpoint are in [api.yaml](api.yaml) (`x-scopes`). A request whose token is
unknown or revoked gets `401`; a valid token without the scope gets `403`. Both bodies are
`{"error": "...", "code": "unauthorized" | "forbidden"}` and never say whether a token
exists.

`machine` and `desktop` devices are bound to one machine id (`device.machine_id`). Ingest
rejects records whose envelope `machine` differs (`machine_mismatch`).

Pulling over SSH (pull mode) needs **no `relay` scope**
(see [machines.md](machines.md) 3.4): the hub itself runs the pull and ingests in-process, as a
**pull device** (`kind = machine`, bound to the pulled machine, `created_by = pull:<target>`)
whose token is generated, hashed and discarded. No token can relay records for another
machine, and the remote holds no token at all.

`device.last_used_at` is updated at most once a minute per device, to avoid a write per
request.

## 4. CLI

All run on the hub machine, against its database directly (no HTTP), so they work before
any token exists.

```
wy hub token create --kind machine|desktop|phone|browser --name <name> [--machine <machine id>] [--json]
    Creates a device and prints its token once.
    --machine is required for machine and desktop (the machine row is created if missing,
    named after --name).
    --json prints {"device": "dev_…", "token": "sy_m_…", "scopes": [...]}.

wy hub token list [--all] [--json]
    Devices: id, kind, name, machine, hint, scopes, created, last used, revoked.
    Revoked devices only with --all.

wy hub token revoke <device id | token hint | name> [--yes]
    Sets revoked_at. Takes effect on the next request (no cache). Asks unless --yes.
    Ambiguous names are refused with the list of matches.
```

On a client:

```
wy connect <hub url> --token <token>     # paste a token made by `wy hub token create`
wy connect <hub url> --code 482-913      # claim a pairing code instead
wy connect <hub url> --code-stdin        # code or pairing secret on stdin (machines.md 4.2)
wy connect <new hub url> --keep-token    # after a hub move, keep the token (machines.md 8.3)
```

`wy connect` checks the URL (HTTPS required unless the host is loopback, or
`--insecure-lan`), calls `GET /health`, then sends one `slot_info` per slot to prove the
token works, and writes `<state>/token` and `hub.url` in `config.toml`.

In merged mode `wy setup` creates the local machine's device itself.

## 5. Pairing codes and owner sessions

Superseded by [pairing.md](pairing.md): codes are 6 digits plus a 128-bit QR secret, hashed
with a pepper kept outside the database, valid 10 minutes, single use, at most 5 live;
`POST /v1/pair/claim` with per-IP and hub-wide limits on typed codes; the QR is an `https://`
URL (`<hub>/#/pair?s=…&c=…`), not JSON. Owner sessions (`sy_o_`) are `browser` devices with
scopes `owner`, `read`, `push`, made from a one-time link (`wy hub owner-link`) and expiring
after 30 days (`device.expires_at`, schema v3).
